Any resulting class performance problems that may arise for those who do not identify their needs will not receive any special grading considerations.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>School-wide Attendance Policy:</strong></p>
<p>Students who do not attend any classes for fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days and fail to notify the Academic Affairs Department will be withdrawn from school.&nbsp; In addition, the student may be involuntarily withdrawn at the discretion of the Academic Director, and with the approval of the Dean of Academic Affairs, at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Withdraw from a Course:</strong></p>
<p>In order to withdraw from a course (that is, receive a grade of "W"), a student must meet with his or her Academic Director before noon on the Friday of week 9.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Dishonesty:</strong></p>
<p>Students are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty while pursuing their studies at The Art Institutes. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to: plagiarism and cheating; misuse of academic resources or facilities; and misuse of computer software, data, equipment or networks.</p>
<p>Plagiarism is the use (copying) of another person\'s ideas, words, visual images or audio samples, presented in a manner that makes the work appear to be the student\'s original creation. All work that is not the student\'s original creation, or any idea or fact that is not "common knowledge," must be documented to avoid even accidental infractions of the conduct code.</p>
<p>Cheating is to gain unfair advantage on a grade by deception, fraud, or breaking the rules set forth by the instructor of the class. Cheating may include but is not limited to: copying the work of others; using notes or other materials when unauthorized; communicating to others during an exam; and any other unfair advantage as determined by the instructor.</p>
<p>Students accused of academic dishonesty will be brought before a Student Conduct Committee. If the committee determines that there has been a violation of the Academic Dishonesty policy, the student will automatically fail the class and, depending on the severity of the infraction, may face further disciplinary action up to and including suspension from classes or expulsion from school.</p>

<p><strong>Disability Policy Statement:</strong></p>
<p>It is our policy not to discriminate against qualified students with documented disabilities in our educational programs, activities, or services. If you have a disability-related need for adjustments or other accommodations in this class see Steven Franklin, Director of Student Affairs located on the 2<sup>nd</sup> &nbsp;floor or e-mail him at sfranklin@aii.edu. You must inform your instructors and the Academic Affairs Office before the end of week one of classes and preferably before the class start.</p>
